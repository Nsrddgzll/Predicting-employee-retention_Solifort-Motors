# TalentRetentionML

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project for Google Advance Data Analytics Certificate, the HR Churn Predictor. The project focuses on predicting employee churn in a company based on a dataset from the HR department. The goal is to provide insights that can help organizations identify potential turnover risks and take proactive measures to retain valuable employees. 

In this lab, I have employed statistical model - Logistic regression,  and  Machine learning models - Random Forrest and XGBoost to predict Employee churn. 

## Overview

Notebook consist of four phases:

**Plan**
Understanding data and Business problem

**Analyse**
This phase covers Data preprocessing, Explarotary Data Analysis, checking model assumptions and selecting models

**Construct**
In this phase, I constructed Logistic regression, Random Forrest and XGBoost and evaluated each model using appropriate metrics

**Execute**
This phase covers interpreting finding and sharing insights 



## Usage

1. Open notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is located in this repository. It includes features such as employee satisfaction, performance, and other relevant attributes.

## Results

Detailed results and performance metrics are presented within the notebook.
